### 1. Document Control

- **Author:** Kalpak Pimpale  
- **Date:** June 18, 2025  
- **Version:** 1.0

### 2. Executive Summary

**QA‑Genie** is an AI‑driven QA automation agent designed to streamline the entire quality assurance pipeline. By ingesting product requirement documents (PRDs), generating test cases, creating tickets in any issue tracker, composing Cucumber feature files, integrating with Git-based repositories, triggering CI jobs, and summarizing results, QA‑Genie transforms a traditionally manual and fragmented QA workflow into a fully automated, end‑to‑end process.

---

### 3. Goals and Objectives

- **Primary Goal:** Automate manual QA workflows to reduce time-to-test and improve test coverage.
- **Key Objectives:**
  - Ingest and understand PRDs in various formats.
  - Generate comprehensive, structured test cases using a large language model.
  - Auto-create and update tickets in Jira, GitHub Issues, GitLab, or Azure Boards.
  - Compose and commit Cucumber feature files to any Git repo.
  - Trigger CI pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) and parse test reports.
  - Provide clear dashboards and summaries for team stakeholders.

### 4. Scope

#### 4.1 In Scope

- PRD ingestion from PDF, Markdown, or plain text.
- LLM-based test-case generation.
- Integration with at least one issue tracker (initially Jira).
- Cucumber feature-file generation and Git commit to Bitbucket/GitHub/GitLab.
- CI trigger and report parsing for Jenkins and GitHub Actions.
- CLI and Web UI for pipeline control and reporting.

#### 4.2 Out of Scope

- Self-healing test maintenance.
- Multi-language test code beyond Java Cucumber.
- Visual QA or performance testing.
- Advanced analytics or ML-driven prioritization.

### 5. User Personas & User Stories

#### 5.1 Personas

- **QA Engineer:** Needs fast, accurate test-case design and execution.
- **Product Owner:** Wants visibility into QA coverage and quick feedback.
- **CTO/Engineering Manager:** Requires metrics on QA efficiency and risk.

#### 5.2 User Stories

1. **As a QA Engineer**, I want to upload a PRD so that QA‑Genie can generate all relevant test cases.  
2. **As a QA Engineer**, I want QA‑Genie to create corresponding tickets in Jira so I can track each test case.  
3. **As a QA Engineer**, I want QA‑Genie to group test cases into Cucumber feature files and commit them to our Git repo.  
4. **As a QA Engineer**, I want QA‑Genie to trigger our CI pipeline and run tests automatically.  
5. **As a QA Engineer**, I want QA‑Genie to parse test reports and notify me of failures via email or Slack.  
6. **As a Product Owner**, I want a dashboard summarizing test-case counts, pass/fail rates, and pending tickets.
